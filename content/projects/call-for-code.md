I, along with four other graduates took part in IBM’s Call for Code hackathon, an event focused on designing technical solutions to help victims of natural disasters. Here I was responsible for designing and developing part of a React front end, alongside promotional videos, for an application to help reunite lost loved ones. Our solution was well received and placed us in the top five of the world-wide competition out of 138 teams and subsequently demoed at IBM’s Think Summit event in London.
